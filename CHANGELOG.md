# Changelog

What changed in each version of Autopen MoJo Active.

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-06)

#### New Features

- MoJo Active icons, a Primary Orange nib on Dark Blue
- APP_ICONS points a build at its own icon set, and scripts/icons.ts --out draws one recolored and named for that app
- Verify:figma checks the import against Figma's own render
- File > Import Figma File… opens a .fig as a new board
- Paste a Figma selection, or drop a .fig file, on the canvas
- Turn a Figma scene into editable layers
- Read Figma files and copied Figma selections

#### Fixes

- Publishing to a releases repository without a CHANGELOG creates one; the README and CHANGELOG carry the app's name, and the README leaves out TestFlight when SKIP_IOS is set
- Read Figma's order keys by their bytes, and guard untrusted parents
- A zero-width Figma stroke draws nothing, and one effect per layer
- Place Figma pages from the boxes Figma measured
- A paste with html but no text still reads the system clipboard

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-06)

#### New Features

- APP_NAME, APP_ID, APP_SCHEME and APP_MCP_PORT make a separate app that installs and runs beside Autopen, with its own data, keychain entry, invite links, MCP port and updater cache
- The SKIP_IOS variable leaves the iPhone build out of a release
- RELAY_URL and VIEW_ORIGIN variables point a build at another relay and browser viewer
- The releases repository comes from the RELEASES_REPO variable, so a downstream copy publishes and updates from its own

#### Fixes

- The drift check fetches upstream with UPSTREAM_TOKEN, not checkout's token
